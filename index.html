		<p>I've made a few things that I want to share because I think they are cool. They are made using Java, C/C++, Javascript, and much, much more. If you are looking for someone that figures things out, look no further.</p>

				<p>This is what I have been working on for a while now. It’s a massive undertaking. The fun part was programming the thing. If you can’t visualize 3d transformations in your head then you would have a really difficult time with it. Some day I will have a live version that you can control over the internet. That would really make things special.</p>
				<p>I am currently on the second hardware revision (the old one broke haha). PLA is not the strongest material and its major downfall is its tendency to melt in a car on a hot day. Revision 2 was a challenge to myself to make all the motors and electronics contained so as to look more like a commercial product.</p>
				<p>The software is really cool. It’s entirely controlled by a web browser. The brain is a Raspberry Pi and hosts a WiFi hotspot so that phones can connect and control. Smile! the camera live streams to the browser too. In the future I am looking into rough 3d mapping from the camera. I plan on using technology similar to motion tracking</p>
